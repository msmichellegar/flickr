# Flickr Project

A reusable module that displays and allows users to search for images from Flickr. A prototype that will then be developed further by an offshore team.

### Tech Stack

The tech stack is as follows:
* Node.js backend
* Hapi.js (+ Inert)
* React.js
* SASS for CSS
* Tape for testing

### Requirements

* The module must be able to be used in multiple locations on the same page.
* The results should be searchable and pageable.
* A README.md file that gives a brief overview of your solution and highlights any part you wish to draw attention to.

### Notes

* Consideration for best practice - accessibility, performance, progressive enhancement, etc. - is expected.
* If you must use a plugin or library please include a clear description of why it is needed.
* Please only create the social tooltip as a placeholder, you do not need to integrate the social behaviour.
* Please include a brief description of your solution and what decisions you made in its creation.
* Please package (rar) your solution and ensure your name forms part of the package file name.
